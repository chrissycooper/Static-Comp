## Wins & Challenges
I really appreciated this project as an exercise in HTML and CSS, there was a lot of aspects of building a site from scratch that I realized I needed more practice with like working out how to make pie charts with CSS. I really loved the challenge of setting up such a complex layout with flexbox. Alson, finding and utilizing all vegetable icons was a lot of fun.
