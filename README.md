## Wins & Challenges
I really appreciated this project as an exercise in HTML and CSS. There are a lot of aspects of building a site from scratch that I realized I needed more practice with. The pure CSS pie charts are a tricky example. I really loved the challenge of setting up such a complex layout with flexbox. Also, finding and utilizing all vegetable icons was a lot of fun.
